<h2>Voila Team</h2>
<p><img src="team1.jpg"> <img src="#.jpg">   The average age of our workers is 27 and the average experience in IT is 6 years. They are young, mentally nimble and well-versed in the latest technologies. Many of them started working with us as senior university students or right after graduation.

Practically all of our workers are certified specialists or masters in IT, applied mathematics, mathematical physics and other IT-related fields. Some of our colleagues continue to teach at universities or conduct scientific researches. It helps us maintain the academic qualification of our staff without distracting from the main project activity.

Thanks to the high value  placed on education, each member of our team is not just a coder, but a highly educated professional who has comprehensive knowledge and experience in all stages of the software development life cycle process. A typical NIX-Solutioner is a universal specialist. Most employees have skills in several specializations (project management, development using a few programming languages). It is a company policy aimed at minimizing project risks connected with the resource supply.

THE METHOD
Our HR policy  is to grow our own forces from the young and talented people rather than hiring mature skilled experts from the street. Besides keeping employee turnover at a minimum, this strategy helps us to build strong professional project teams where everybody shares the Company’s values.

NIX Solutions is constantly in touch with the city’s universities to select and train new employees as well as provide advanced training for existing staff. Instructions are delivered on a regular basis in the form of courses and seminars on various aspects of software development. Our subject matter experts are assigned to each department to provide ongoing teaching and learning process with the technical teams. Following the leading edge technology domain, they deliver training materials, manage the skills upgrade process, create qualification tests,  and assess prospective candidates. These activities ensure the high proficiency levels of our teams.

HOW IT WORKS
The Development Team is divided into functional groups depending on the employees’ experience and skills. Role assignments are made according to the process selected for the given project. For medium- and large-sized projects, a project team consists of the following groups:

Management (project and group leaders);
Analysis and Design (system analysts and system architects);
Engineering (developers, database administrators);
Quality Assurance and Control (reviewers, testers, test designers);
Design and Usability (art designers, interface designers);
Infrastructure Support (system administrators who maintain network, source control system, defect-tracking system, workspace and build environment);
Technical Writers and Translators.
Project teams are formed on a components-and-roles basis, i.e., experts that belong to various function teams and a team leader are assigned to a certain project area. One team member can combine several roles if the scope of the component to be developed is relatively small. This principle of organizing project teams with the right experts enables the fastest development with the lowest number of bugs.
